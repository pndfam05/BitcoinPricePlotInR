# BitcoinPricePlotInR
Useful to plot the average price (USD) of Bitcoin sales for every day since Bitcoin started trading. Not my original work, the work was done by Robert Rickert (http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2015/11/accessing-bitcoin-data-with-r.html).

I have made some minor modifications to summarise() because I think the dplyr package changed.
